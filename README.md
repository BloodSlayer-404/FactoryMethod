### Introduction:
This is an example of the creational design pattern called "Factory Method" for an app that helps you learn about design patterns, you can find that app [here](https://github.com/JoseMartinez117/AppPatrones "here").

#### About: 
The example tries to simulate how distinct Minecraft enemies behave in specific situations, like walking, jumping, attacking, or dying. There is a factory for each enemy, allowing you to generate as many enemies as you want.

You can create your logic for the generation of enemies using the classes that this app provides. 

#### Documentation: 
The documentation of the methods and classes created for the example is in the [Javadoc](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/FactoryMethod/tree/master/JavaDoc "Javadoc") folder. 

You can check the coverage of the unitary test created for this proyect in the [htmlReport](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/FactoryMethod/tree/master/htmlReport "htmlReport") folder, you can create more test for your own methods.

### Introduction:
This is an example of the creational design pattern called "Factory Method" for an app that helps you learn about design patterns, you can find that app [here](https://github.com/JoseMartinez117/AppPatrones "here").

#### About: 
The example tries to simulate how distinct Minecraft enemies behave in some situations, like walking, jumping, attacking or diying. There is a factory for each enemy, allowing the generation of how many enemies you want.
You can create your own logic for the generation of the enemies using the classes that this app provides. 

#### Documentation: 
The documentation of the methods and classes created for the example is in the [Javadoc](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/FactoryMethod/tree/master/JavaDoc "Javadoc") folder. 

You can check the coverage of the unitary test created for this proyect in the [htmlReport](https://github.com/BloodSlayer-404/FactoryMethod/tree/master/htmlReport "htmlReport") folder, you can create more test for your own methods if you want.
